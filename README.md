Hello there, thanks for checking out my GitHub profile! My name is Jeffrey Lanters, and I was born and living in The Netherlands. Although I initially started my studies in game development and design, I eventually fell in love with application and web development, leading me to discover the incredible open-source community. Which now, I take great pride in contributing to both game and application development within.

In recent years, I co-founded my own studio; Hulan, where we combine our passion for technology and design to create a diverse range of products. Our creations includes everything from serious games to dashboards, and from virtual reality experiences to artificial intelligence applications. Feel free to come by if you're nearby!

「レトロ」ゲームへの愛から、私は2022年に日本語の勉強を始めました。私はまだお気に入りのRPGを字幕なしでプレイするには長い道のりがありますが、それは見逃したくない冒険です！自由に日本語で話しかけてください。英語やオランダ語でも構いませんよ！そして、良いゲームのおすすめがあればいつでも歓迎します。

Feel free to use any of my modules. If you're using any of these modules for production purposes, please consider sponsoring me to support my open-source projects. It means the world to me and truly enables me to continue doing what I love. Your support is immensely appreciated! Thank you!
