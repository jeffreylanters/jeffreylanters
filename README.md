### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jeffrey Lanters, born and living in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. Iâ€™m a developer and designer in a broad field of games and apps, from entertainment to serious.

My interest in game development started from an early age, as did my first experiences in programming and development through personal projects and initiatives. Whilst completing my studies in Game Development and Game Design, I professionalized in developing games through my many hobbies, freelance projects and the earning of certificates.

I now work full time at the gamification-oriented business Hulan, which Rob Hulsen and I founded in early 2015. With growing knowledge of programming and interests in all areas of games and applications - for both entertainment and education - I look forward to a refreshing and innovative future.
