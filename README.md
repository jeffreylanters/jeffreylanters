# Heyya' ðŸ‘‹

I'm glad you're here, thanks for checking out my profile. My name is Jeffrey Lanters, born and living in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. Iâ€™m a developer and designer in a broad field of games and apps, love to teach about game development, and help others by contributing in the world of open source software. On the rare occasion I'm not behind my screen, I'm probably at my horses, working on my car, or petting my cats. 

I've been a Unity developer since 2012. While getting interested in web-development I realised Unity was lacking an open source community, so I decided to start sharing my modules by open-sourcing them starting from 2020. And so a new hobby was born and I created the ["El Raccoone-Project"](https://github.com/elraccoone) GitHub team. It somewhat became my part-time job to build and share open software on this profile. I'm getting really excited to helping other developers, and seeing people build awesome stuff using my tools.

Thank you so much! and feel free to use any of my modules. If you're using this module for production, please consider [donating to support the project](https://jeffreylanters.nl/donate). It does mean the world to me, and it really helps me going with the project.
